# Welcome to Web Visions
One of the really cool things about working for a company like Planning Center, is the fact that they will give you 5 conference days and pay for you to go to any conference of your choosing.

My first conference experience set the bar high. I was privileged to experience An Event Apart in Austin in 2012. I met some really cool people and gained some knowledge during my time there.

My most recent conference was Web Visions PDX 2016.

The event itself was very free flowing, and had a laid back and relaxed attitude, which was pretty helpful in terms of breaking down any social walls that people might have and getting us all to engage with one another.

The talks were also very well rounded and diverse. Ranging from the progression of automation with AI in all the industries, work culture diversification, and just regular good old fashioned kick ass design (I'm somewhat of a fan).
